            <h1>1st place - ESN Lisbon</h1>
            <h2>How do they describe themselves?</h2>
            <p>
              Our section was founded in September of 2008 by 9 former Erasmus
              students. They surprisingly found out that there was no ESN in our
              beautiful city, so they decided to create ESN Lisboa. Instead of
              creating several ESN sections in the same city, they decided to
              create a single section to establish good relations with all
              universities. The section grew very fast due to the enormous
              amount of Portuguese students returning every year from Erasmus
              and flourished within its structure. In less than 6 years we had a
              legal foundation, statutes, standing orders, a solid hierarchic
              and democratic structure, strong activities, trips and parties,
              multiple partnerships, participation in all the international
              projects, high level network involvement and an extraordinary fast
              learning curve for all the active members. Through non-formal
              education, the learning process was facilitated by our members
              involved in the Eduk8 project (Tiago Costa, Inês Moreira, Inês
              Cunha and Lério Cunha) and supported by the HR department. Yet, we
              shouldn’t forget the knowledge that comes from experient older
              members/Alumni. Sometimes, what we need is a practical answer, a
              faster and more efficient solution that only can be given by
              people that experienced the same problem/situation. In the last
              three years, ESN Lisboa has grown from 25 to 55 active members,
              the internal structure expanded to 8 departments and 6 board
              members, in order to address the workload due to the increasing
              number of incoming students in Lisbon, currently around 5,000
              exchange students per year.

            <h2>2nd place - ESN Politecnico Milano</h2>
            <p>
              ESN Politecnico Milano was founded 6th February 1992, it was one
              of the first sections in Italy. In 1994 i become one of the
              founding members of ESN Italy, from 2005 it is part of the
              coordination of ESN a Milano Unita (composed by the six sections
              of Milan). In its twentyfour-year history, it has been one of the
              most active sections of the network. In December 2011 it organized
              a National Platform, in 2013 it took care of the organization of
              ESN Italy National Event and, in 2014, it organized the AGM, in
              collaboration with the others Milan’s sections. Over the years it
              has consolidated its relationship with the University and with a
              lot of institutional partners. We are pleased to be supported by
              the Municipality of Milan, that often gives us its official
              patronage and support us during our biggest events, for example
              providing us some venues and/or sponsorship. Since 2008, it
              organized in partnership with ESN Milano Statale, the new year eve
              anticipated, the CRAZY COUNTDOWN: an unforgettable night at which
              they are invited to participate all sections Italian! We are
              deeply interested in ESN National and International level, that is
              why we save every year some money to invest in this kind of event.
              We NEVER miss a National Platform or national events and project.
              We always partecipate to both SWEP and SEEP, and we wait all the
              year to attend the AGM.

            <h2>3rd place - ESN KTU</h2>
            <p>
              ESN Kaunas University of Technology was established in 2009 by a
              small group of students. At first the board was concluded of the
              president and vice president. Whereas the whole ESN KTU team
              included ten people. The first international event attended by ESN
              KTU members was NEP. After this experience we got inspired to
              organize our own events: white t-shirt party, foam party, card
              party. The very first big challenge was to organize ESN Summer
              Camp which started out as a national event but evolved into the
              first international event in 2011. Autumn of 2014 was one of the
              turning points to our organization: since then ALL students of
              Kaunas University of Technology can become ESN KTU members, it
              means that Lithuanians as well as international students currently
              not only participate in ESN activities but also organize them.
